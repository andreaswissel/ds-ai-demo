1. Let's work on this Figma file: https://www.figma.com/design/ojQcb8vS8mhTODEqXZMrEH/MCP-TEST?node-id=1-105&t=LuJXLtsW5OuRWTkJ-4
2. Check for any components in the Figma file and implement any new components in this project. We're starting from scratch, no components are in the project yet. Proceed until you have finished implementing all components exactly like they are listed in Figma. Make sure to match all visual properties
3. Get the specification for the Button component and check if any changes need to be made to the existing code.
